All repositories are moved to https://gitee.com/xd15zhn ，  
Updating of codes on github are pause。  
Git commit messages:  
```
git commit -m "12.03 2010  
laptop"  
```
The first line is commit date and time, the format is: (month).(date) (hour)(minute)  
The second line is the place or device to commit.  
For the reason that we can see the details of commit messages of Git,so the commit time in first line is the last modified time of codes.  
For example, if didn't commit after finishing the code immediately in the afternoon of December 3rd, but commited in the morning of December 4th, the commit time in first line is still December 3rd.
